# get-prog
Gets all instances of program or opens program and brings to front

I use this to setup global keyboard shortcuts in linux systems with _xdotool_ installed.

The original purpose was to maintain a single instance of _terminator_ being open at a time as all borders/task bars/menus had been removed.

But I repurposed it as a general application to access my full suite of windows while in fullscreen mode
